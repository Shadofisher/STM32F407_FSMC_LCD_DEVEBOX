# STM32F407_FSMC_LCD_DEVEBOX

Example project based on the STM32F407 + ILI9341 LCD board (DEVEBOX)
The source files from the manufarturer compiled but did not work on this board due to an issue with the FSMC_A18 lines controlling the RS select on the LCD


This code is a rework of the demo with this issue corrected
